    say FILEHANDLE LIST
    say FILEHANDLE
    say LIST
    say     Just like "print", but implicitly appends a newline. "say LIST"
            is simply an abbreviation for "{ local $\ = "\n"; print LIST }".
            To use FILEHANDLE without a LIST to print the contents of $_ to
            it, you must use a bareword filehandle like "FH", not an
            indirect one like $fh.

            "say" is available only if the "say" feature is enabled or if it
            is prefixed with "CORE::". The "say" feature is enabled
            automatically with a "use v5.10" (or higher) declaration in the
            current scope.
